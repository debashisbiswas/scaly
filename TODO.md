# TODO

## create flow

- implement missing "choose how many octaves" screen
- would you like to set this as your default range? modal
- anchor "select all" buttons to the bottom
- tempo: move tempo with range slider
- tempo: allow tapping on the bpm value to type
- every screen: disable next button until valid selection
  - remove validation and popup from final page
- range up to C7

## practice screen

- lots of work needed here
