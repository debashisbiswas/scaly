# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Notation harness

Use the local browser harness to iterate on VexFlow rendering without the React Native WebView layer.

1. Install deps if needed:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the harness:

   ```bash
   npm run notation:harness
   ```

3. Open the local Vite URL and switch between Range staff / Practice staff renderers.

Range rendering source lives in `src/notation/range.ts`, practice rendering source lives in `src/notation/practice.ts`, and the harness app lives in `tools/notation-harness`.
